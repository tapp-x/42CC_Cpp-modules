# CPP Modules

This repository contains a series of C++ exercises designed to improve your understanding and proficiency in C++ programming. Each module focuses on different aspects of the language and provides practical exercises to reinforce learning.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several modules, each containing multiple exercises:

- `cpp00/`
- `cpp01/`
- `cpp02/`
- `cpp03/`
- `cpp04/`
- `cpp05/`
- `cpp06/`
- `cpp07/`
- `cpp08/`
- `cpp09/`

Each module directory contains subdirectories for individual exercises, with source files and Makefiles for building the exercises.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run an exercise from `cpp09/ex02`:

```sh
cd cpp09/ex02
make
./ex02 <list of positive integers>
